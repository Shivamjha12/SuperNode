# SuperNode

In graph theory, a SuperNode is a node that connects to more than 8000 edges. Inspired by this concept, we named our link and URL management tool as SuperNode.

## Features Wanted to Implement
1. Share Links: Different links at one place with the best design. Included 5 most used social media websites.
2. Link group feature with LinkLists Tab.
3. Link Adding Schedule.
4. Redirect user link with some specified keyword. For example, domain/user2/Instagram -> redirect to user Instagram.
5. Analytical Dashboard tool for viewing traffic of links and LinkLists.
6. Searching Functionality for finding users.
7. If you have any social media handle link of user, you can search their other social media or person profile using that link.
8. Deep search that can find some person related to some person.
9. If someone you follow on supernode, you can see their activities from all connected social media.
10. We create an API service where providers give one Social Media link and if that matches on our DB, we return all other social media links of the user.
